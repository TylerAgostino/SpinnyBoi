I've seen pros wreck doing this....Good luck, amateurs.
Good luck.
Try not to wreck this time.

Just remember, it's not about winning, it's about having fun and embarrassing yourself in front of your friends.

You know Koffard is a mod now, just ask him next time.
Thankfully you didn't use Corey's wrists to spin. That would have taken forever.
Did you do the standings update first?
I can hear Nolan now, "AND WE'RE UNDERWAY!"
You know Gio is gonna win so what's the point?
Y'all are a bunch of nerds.
Standings update?
Good luck with the race recaps on this one Nolan.
Can you imagine this with RAIN?
Did you do the Beer Thread?
Caution bot running?
If you tip me a few bucks I can do better.
Is it rolling or standing starts? I can't remember.
