I've seen pros wreck doing this....Good luck, amateurs.
Good luck.
Try not to wreck this time.
Fun fact: the more you drink, the worse everyone else's driving gets.
If you can finish one without causing a wreck, you're either a pro driver or you're not drinking enough.
Just remember, it's not about winning, it's about having fun and embarrassing yourself in front of your friends.

Just remember, if you crash out, it's not the alcohol's fault, it's yours.
...inb4 "Can I get a black flag cleared?"
Unfortunately you have to turn left AND right this time.
You know Koffard is a mod now <:HedMod:1207371810534858822>, just ask him next time.
Did you do the standings update first?
Nolan doesn't get paid nearly enough for you idiots.
<:Joe_Parmesan:1206623651521105960> You know Gio is gonna win so what's the point?
Y'all are a bunch of nerds.
Standings update?
Good luck with the race recaps on this one Nolan.
Can you imagine this with RAIN?
Did you do the Beer Thread?
Caution bot running?
If you tip me a few bucks I can do better.
Is it rolling or standing starts? I can't remember.
Please, God not Daytona Oval again
Are you feeling lucky?
Summit Point Jefferson <:ThonkitPointJefferson:1212153828766388266>! Naa J/K try this instead
Look at that cloud Morgan! It looks like a duck!
Merry Case Race!
Don't forget the clamps
Don't forget to watch Koffard's track guide... unless he doesn't feel like making one.
Make sure Mac charges his headset
Has Ron posted his empties yet?
Watch out for those EOLs
Remember to call your corner
If only there were a torrential downpour at this track. That'd be a big shame.
