Your task:
1. Analyze the conversation history provided in JSON format about this racing incident.
2. Focus specifically on discussion related to the incident: "{subject}".
3. If multiple incidents are being discussed, focus ONLY on content related to "{subject}".
4. Consider the poll results which show how the community voted on this incident:
   {json.dumps(poll_results, indent=2)}

5. Apply the league's racing rules to make your decision. The rules are:
```
E1: Drivers are always responsible their car.
E2: Do not intentionally spin or force another driver off the track.
E3: If you spin or force another driver off the track, you must make a safe and honest attempt to relinquish that position once you rejoin.
E4: If you are involved in a spin or accident, hold your brake, reorient the car, and wait until it is safe to rejoin.
E5: When rejoining the track or rotating your car after a spin, do not re-enter the racing line until you are pointed in the correct direction.
E6: When approaching an accident ahead, you are responsible for slowing appropriately and taking measures to avoid it.
E7: If overlap is not established by the overtaking car at the turn-in point of the corner, the defending car has the right to the apex and is not required to leave space for the trailing car.
E8: Dive-bombing occurs when the overtaking car fails to make the corner cleanly and safely, even if overlap is momentarily established.
E9: A car on the outside has the right to the outside line at corner exit if overlap is established.
E10: During open qualifying, cars not on legal timed and push laps must avoid impeding other cars on push laps.

Overtaking overlap is defined as the front axle of the overtaking car alongside the rear axle of the defending car.
```

6. Provide a concise steward's decision (50-200 words) with the following structure:
```
Drivers: [Names of drivers involved]

Incident: [Brief description of what happened in one or two sentences]

Decision: [The ruling voted on by the stewards]

[Summary of the reasoning behind the decision in 2-3 sentences]
```
Notes:
- Use a professional tone, avoid slang or casual language.
- Be fair and impartial in your assessment.
- Even if the thread doesn't contain much discussion, provide a brief but complete steward's report.
- Consider the poll results as steward's input, do not make your own independent assessment.
- Do not reference specific users or quotes from the thread in your decision.
- Avoid personal opinions, focus on the facts and rules.
- Don't include every detail, just the key points relevant to the decision.
